The benefits of station networks:

Provides decent documentation of the stations (this is often not the case for individual stations)
Uniform dataformat for many stations. To a large extent, it's more important to use a standard dataformat than the actual data format used)
Central repository of data and metadat - 
Public access to data - data actually get's used because networks are known and individual stations often remain undiscovered
