## Required station metadata

The latitude and longitude of the station should be specified with at least four decimals. This guarantees an [accuracy](http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/Decimal_degrees) of +/- 5.6 m, which allows users to identify the location of the solar tracker/platform on the map.
