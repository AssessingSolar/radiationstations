    "# Station requirements and categorization\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to determine the scope, specifically which types of stations and parameters to include. As the focus of SolarStations.org is on high-quality stations, only stations that measure all three irradiance components are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Station categorization\n",
    "High-quality stations can be classified into two different categories: Tier 1 and Tier 2 stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tier 1 stations\n",
    "Tier 1 stations are defined as those that meet all of the following requirements:\n",
    "* measurement of direct normal irradiance (DNI) with a Class A thermopile pyrheliometer mounted on a solar tracker\n",
    "* measurement of diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI) with a Spectrally Flat Class A thermopile pyranometer shaded by a shading ball\n",
    "* measurement of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) with a Spectrally Flat Class A thermopile pyranometer\n",
    "\n",
    "Seperate measurement of GHI is required for Tier 1 stations as most quality control procedures relies on comparing the measured and calculated GHI (closure equation). The stations in the [BSRN](https://bsrn.awi.de/) network are examples of Tier 1 stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tier 2 stations\n",
    "Tier 2 stations are defined as those that do not meet the Tier 1 requirements but meet one of the following specifications:\n",
    "* Meets two of the three requirements of Tier 1 stations\n",
    "* Measures GHI and DHI using a rotating shading band pyranometer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-qualifying stations\n",
    "Stations that measure DHI using a shadow band are not considered, as such measurements are notoriously unreliable due to the shadow bands having to be manually adjusted every few days.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Station metadata\n",
    "The central part of the catalog is the list of stations and their metadata, including:\n",
    "* Latitude, longitude, and elevation (according to ISO format)\n",
    "* Years of operation\n",
    "* City and Country\n",
    "* Station name\n",
    "* Station abbreviation\n",
    "* Station network (e.g., BSRN, SURFRAD)\n",
    "* Link to the station or network website (multiple links?)\n",
    "\n"
